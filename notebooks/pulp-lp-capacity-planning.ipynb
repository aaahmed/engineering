    "# Linear Programming for Macro Capacity Planning with PuLP\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the PuLP package for production network optimization and capacity planning. More information on PuLP can be found at https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/ \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two general types of network optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Short-term/Tactical/Micro: on a daily/weekly horizon, how should we produce and ship based on demand forecasts and current inventory levels?\n",
    "* Long-term/Strategic/Macro: on a 1-10 year horizon, how should we invest our resources and capital to get the best return on investment and support our business's stragic goals (e.g., market share)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions that the stategic/macro network planner needs to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How unoptimized is our current supply chain/logistics network?\n",
    "* What would demand growth need to be to justify building a new factory vs. co-manufacturing?\n",
    "* Where should we build a new factory/warehouse?\n",
    "* Which factory should we consider shutting down?\n",
    "* Where should we produce the new product we want to launch?"
